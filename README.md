## about the device

You can use this project as an example for your development of smart devices working with Utopia Ecosystem. This may be a device that monitors the status of the network, mining, synchronization, and so on.

This example uses RGB: flashing blue signal when connected to Wifi, red signal on error and green if successful.

As a board with a controller, NodeMCU WeMos is used.

Also, this solution can be used as an example of the use of UtopiaAPI.
